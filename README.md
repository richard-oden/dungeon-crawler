# Dungeon Crawler Combat Demo
This is a multiplayer combat demo for dungeon crawler, a simple turn-based RPG terminal game borrowing heavily from D&D, and using a D20-based system. Completed as part of the Code Louisville September 2020 C# Class.

## A note
UTF-8 encoding is needed or some characters may not render properly. In Command Prompt / Powershell, one way to ensure this is to use `chcp 65001` before running the game.
